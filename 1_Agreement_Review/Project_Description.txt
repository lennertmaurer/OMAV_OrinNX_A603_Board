I have a new order! This time a lot simpler than the power board (hopefully).

- We have a new Jetson Carrier Board (https://www.seeedstudio.com/A603-Carrier-Board-for-Jetson-Orin-NX-Nano-p-5635.html)

- For its pinheader we would like to make a small PCB that has the following features:
o BMI088 IMU integrated
o Nice connectors for I2C, SPI, GPIOs
o The carrier board has a USB connection that is accessible via a 20-pin ribbon cable. We would like to grind this onto the PCB and then make a JST GH connector out of it (for the connection to the power board)
o Possibly, if there is space: a 3.3V button battery with a short connector so that the clock on the carrier board maintains the status.
So apart from the IMU, practically no active components are needed, and voltages are also available directly from the carrier board in 3.3V and 5V.

In the attached PDF I have sketched the whole thing (PCB_Sketch.pdf), just with pin connections etc. Together with the Carrier Board Datasheet this should be reasonably complete.

Miscellaneous:
- PCB should be able to be screwed well to the carrier, hence the strange shape
- For vibration damping: A thick PCB if possible
- Design should be as minimal, simple and straightforward as possible so that it can be easily adapted in the future
- Silkscreen important:
o IMU orientation (coordinate system)
o IMU position to a reference point (e.g. a screw)
o Label pins on the plugs
